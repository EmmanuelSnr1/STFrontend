The main objective of this project is to develop a prototype of an easy-to-use stock market research system that 
can be used by retail investors to research the stock market. Alongside academic aims for this project, it aims to 
undergo a long-term business undertaking that will inform the design and implementation of this project.
To ensure an optimal solution is achieved, this report will discuss and moreover justify the incorporation of 
highly sophisticated technologies, such as the Django MVT, Django Rest Framework, IEX Cloud, and React 
JS. In addition, a variety of stakeholder perspectives and existing systems will be analysed giving perspective to 
the aims and objectives of the project.

# Note: 
This project was created as part of a business Initiative and an Honours Dissertation Project. 

# Project Directory: 
A summary of the Project directory is as follows: 
The entire code for this application is submitted alongside the project. Figure 19 below Is a high-level
Description and summary for the repository for this project. A hybrid combination of Python Django (in red)
and ReactJS (in blue) was used to implement this application (See chapter 5 – Design for system architecture).

The Django backend implemented was geared towards implementing basic functionalities (with MTV architecture) for 
the website and were later modeled into APIs to be consumed by a dedicated front end (React.JS). Due to the system 
having a dedicated frontend, the Django backend views were made basic just to demonstrate functionalities. In addition, 
each major functionality implemented are known as apps in Django which contains major files and directories as 
demonstrated in figure 19.
